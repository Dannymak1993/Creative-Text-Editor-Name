# Creative-Text-Editor-Name

## Description

This application is a text editor that focuses on progress web app concepts. This means the app should be downloadable to your desktop via manifest. It should retain some offline functionality if there is no network connection. When the app is opened on the browser again all the progress made offline should be reflected. The new technology utilized in this application include concurrently, webpack, manifest and babel.

## Usage

To use this application, begin by navigating to to URL linked in the installation section. You can use the text editor on the browser itself or download a local version to use offline by clicking on the install button in the top left corner. The local and web versions are synchronous meaning any changes to one will carry over to the other.
